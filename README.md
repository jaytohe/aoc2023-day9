# Advent of Code - Day 9

My solution to [Adven of Code - Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9) in Clojure!

- solution.clj contains the normal recursive solutions for Parts 1 and 2.

- optimized_solution.clj contains the tail recursive solutions.

To run the solution(s), you need to [install Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) and then run `clj -M optimized_solution.clj` from the terminal.
